# hello-world
my first encounter with git

Hi Everyone!

Prashant here, I am a software engineer currently working as support analyst in a production support domain
I would like to change my profile and am confused in selecting the right career to progress in.

I hope joining GitHub helps me to get rid of the confusion.

Thanks.
